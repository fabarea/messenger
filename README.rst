Messenger Extension
===================

Messenger Extension is a TYPO3 extension for listing recipients in a flexible way and send them emails to them. The extension basically contains:

* A email is composed by two parts: a message template and a possible layout. The layout will wrap the template.
  This can be useful if the message must be surrounded
  by a footer / header containing a logo or some default text.
* Messenger will send **multi-parted email** which contains a HTML
  version next to a plain text within the same email.
* Body message can be written in **Markdown syntax**
  alongside with **Fluid View Helper** which will be be rendered when sending the email.
* A message can be queued and scheduled for mass mailing

Installation
============

Extension have settings mainly in the Extension Manager. Most of them are self-explanatory.


Message API
===========

Usage::

	$templateIdentifier = 1; // uid
	$layoutIdentifier = 1; // uid
	$recipients = array('john@doe.com' => 'John Doe');
	$markers = array(
	  'first_name' => 'John',
	  'last_name' => 'Doe',
	);
	$languageIdentifier = 0; // sys_language_uid
	$pathToFile = 'some-path-to-file'; // @todo replace me with FAL identifier

	/** @var \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Object\ObjectManager $objectManager */
	$objectManager = \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance('TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Object\ObjectManager');

	/** @var \Fab\Messenger\Domain\Model\Message $message */
	$message = $objectManager->get('Fab\Messenger\Domain\Model\Message');

	# Minimum required to be set
	$message->setMessageTemplate($templateIdentifier)
		->setTo($recipients)

	# Additional setter
	$message->assign('foo', $bar)
		->setLanguage($languageIdentifier)
		->addAttachment($pathToFile)
		->setMessageLayout($layoutIdentifier);

	# Possible debug before sending.
	# var_dump($message->toArray());

	# Send the email...
	$isSent = $message->send();


Configuration
=============

Following configuration should be configured. The default sender name::

	$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL']['defaultMailFromName'] = 'John Doe';
	$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL']['defaultMailFromAddress'] = 'john@doe.com';

Whenever Application Context is in Development, there is the chance to define
default target recipients which is convenient for not leaking email.
**Tip**: install extension ``EXT:application_context_hints`` to display some hints in the BE
about the current application context along with some global variables.

::

	$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL']['development']['recipients'] = 'fudriot@cobweb.ch';


Message View Helper
===================

View Helper which are bundled with this extension. The first oen is to render a generic item from the array of markers::

	# The minimum declaration
	<m:widget.show item="markerName" dataType="tx_ext_foo"/>

	# Additional attributes
	<m:widget.show item="markerName" dataType="tx_ext_foo" exclude="{0: 'fieldName'}" displaySystemFields="true"/>

	{namespace m=Fab\Messenger\ViewHelpers}

Retrieve the body of the email being sent. Useful to display to the User a feedback message
after a form has been posted which is actually the same as of the email::

	<m:show.body key="{settings.messageTemplate}"/>

Fluid templates
===============

More of Fluid's power can be used if the template is stored in external files.
In such a case layouts can be used. They have to be stored in a folder called
"Layouts", placed in the same folder as the template itself.

For example, if the template is located at "EXT:foo/Resource/Private/Templates/Mail/Bar.html"
it may refer to layouts located in "EXT:foo/Resource/Private/Templates/Mail/Layouts".

Furthermore, it is possible to choose "Fluid only" as a templating engine when
defining a message template. In such a case the Markdown interpreter will not run.
This means that the Fluid template can be written more freely.

Queue
=====

Alpha feature!

Messenger has the feature to queue emails. This is mandatory as soon as making mass-mailing.

@todo scheduler is not yet implemented.

::

	/** @var \Fab\Messenger\Domain\Model\Message $message */
	$message = $objectManager->get('Fab\Messenger\Domain\Model\Message');
	$message->
		... // same as in the example above
		->queue();


Scheduler tip
=============

When sending messages using Messenger within a Scheduler task, the base url must be transmitted **as environment variable "TYPO3_BASE_URL"**.
The reasons is to have Fluid having the good context so that the ViewHelpers work as they would be in the context of the Frontend::

	TYPO3_BASE_URL=http://www.domain.tld typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh scheduler

Additionally, you can set Development context with the environment variable "TYPO3_CONTEXT". Example::

	TYPO3_CONTEXT=Development TYPO3_BASE_URL=http://www.domain.tld typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh scheduler


Todo
====

Long term goals:

+ Provide default FE / BE Users provider in Vidi
+ The same message can be sent in various language

Recipient Interface
===================

@todo check if that is still true with Vidi integration

A recipient interface is provided making sure a user can be correctly displayed within the table. The interface is not mandatory to
be implemented since a recipient can be in the form of an array. However, a minimum of ``uid`` and ``email`` must be provided.
An exception will be raised on the run time if something goes wrong.
